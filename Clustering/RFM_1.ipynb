    "### What is RFM Analysis ?\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank & group customers based on their transaction history .\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Recency : How recently a customer made a purchase .\n",
    "> - Frequency : How often a customer makes a purchase .\n",
    "> - Monetary : How much money a customer spends on purchases .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use RFM Analysis ?\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM helps businesses understand customer behaviour and segment customers to different groups for targeted marketing . Mainly used for customer segmentation ( identifying high value customers) , personalized marketing , customer retention\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM analysis is best used when you have transactional data and want to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviour . it is particularly useful for businesses with a large customer base and frequent transactions ."
