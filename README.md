# Machine Learning Tutorial Repository

This repository contains tutorials and working examples of various machine learning concepts, organized into the following folders:

## Folders

- Clustering
- Decision Tree
- Feature Engineering

## Clustering

This folder includes tutorials and examples on different clustering techniques:

- **K-Means**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, useful for finding clusters of varying shapes and sizes.
- **RFM**: Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis, often used in marketing to segment customers.

## Decision Tree

This folder covers decision tree-based algorithms:

- **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model used for classification and regression tasks.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

## Feature Engineering

This folder focuses on techniques to prepare and transform data for machine learning models:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on various feature engineering techniques.
- **Examples**: Practical examples demonstrating the application of these techniques.
