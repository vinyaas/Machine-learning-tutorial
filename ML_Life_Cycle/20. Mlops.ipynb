    "# MLOps: Machine Learning Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is a set of practices designed to streamline and automate the lifecycle of machine learning (ML) models, from development to deployment and maintenance. It combines principles from DevOps and DataOps to ensure that ML models are developed, tested, and deployed efficiently and reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What MLOps Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automates ML Workflows**: MLOps automates repetitive tasks such as data preparation, model training, and deployment, making the process more efficient.\n",
    "2. **Ensures Consistency**: By standardizing processes, MLOps ensures that models are developed and deployed consistently across different environments.\n",
    "3. **Improves Collaboration**: MLOps facilitates collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and IT operations teams, ensuring that everyone is aligned and working towards common goals.\n",
    "4. **Enhances Monitoring and Maintenance**: MLOps includes tools for monitoring model performance in production and triggers retraining or updates when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How MLOps Helps Data Scientists\n",
    "\n",
