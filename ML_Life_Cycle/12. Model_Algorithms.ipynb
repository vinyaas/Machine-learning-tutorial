    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation. It aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "Logistic Regression predicts the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic function. It outputs values between 0 and 1, which can be thresholded to classify observations.\n",

    "- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Predicting whether a customer will leave a subscription service based on their usage patterns and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "Decision Trees split the data into branches based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure. Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Random Forest\n",
    "\n",

    "**Real-Life Scenario**:\n",
    "- **Credit Scoring**: Assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants based on their financial history and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions. It reduces overfitting and improves generalization by averaging the results of many trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Text Classification**: Classifying documents into categories such as news, sports, entertainment, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes. It can handle non-linear classification by using kernel functions to project the data into higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type**: Classification and Regression\n",

    "- For smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-Life Scenario**:\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Recommending products to users based on the preferences of similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "KNN classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors. For regression, it predicts the value based on the average of the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)\n",

    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "GBM builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one. It uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function.\n",
