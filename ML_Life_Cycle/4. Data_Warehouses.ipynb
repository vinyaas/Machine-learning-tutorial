    "## Data Lake First, then Data Warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Ingestion into Data Lake\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw Data**: Raw, unstructured, and semi-structured data from various sources like logs, social media, clickstreams, etc. is ingested directly into the data lake. This allows for flexible storage and rapid ingestion without needing to define the structure upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration and Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Scientists**: Use the data lake for exploratory data analysis, identifying patterns, trends, and creating features for machine learning models. This stage involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structuring and Loading into Data Warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "**ETL Process**: Once the data is cleaned and structured, it is transformed into a format suitable for business intelligence and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading**: The transformed, structured data is then loaded into the data warehouse. This allows for efficient querying and generating regular reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Lake:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ingestion**: Raw clickstream data from a website is ingested into the data lake.\n",
    "2. **Exploration**: Data scientists explore this data to understand user behavior, clean it, and create features for predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading**: The cleaned and structured clickstream data is loaded into the data warehouse.\n",
    "2. **Analysis**: Business analysts generate reports and dashboards to monitor website performance and user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Storing raw data in the data lake provides flexibility to handle various data types and perform different analytics tasks.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Structured data in the data warehouse allows for efficient querying and reporting, making it easier for business teams to access insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Some companies might have different setups, like using a data warehouse first for highly structured environments or running parallel systems where some data directly goes to the warehouse.\n",
